# ARN_Cloud_Kitchen
Hii<br>
I have created a web page using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The purpose of this web page is to show the prototype for the Aditi's Cloud Kitchen.
<br>
The products are diplayed along with their names and prices.
<br>
When a user clicks on the Add to cart button the name of the item will be displayed on the Item list below and the total amount will be incremented based on the food items selected.
<br>
When the user clicks on the confirm order button a Message will be displayed at the bottm that is the confirmation message for the order placed.
